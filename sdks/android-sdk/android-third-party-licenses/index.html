However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</p><p>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</p><p>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</p><p>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</p><p>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</p><p>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p><p>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p><p>   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.</p><p>      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following</p><p>      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets &quot;[]&quot;</p><p>      replaced with your own identifying information.

It also counts</p><p> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence</p><p> the version number 2.1.]</p><p>                Preamble</p><p>  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</p><p>freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</p><p>Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change</p><p>free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p><p>  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some</p><p>specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the</p><p>Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You</p><p>can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether</p><p>this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better</p><p>strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</p><p>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,</p><p>not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that</p><p>you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge</p><p>for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get</p><p>it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of</p><p>it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do</p><p>these things.</p><p>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</p><p>distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these</p><p>rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for</p><p>you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</p><p>  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</p><p>or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</p><p>you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</p><p>code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide</p><p>complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them</p><p>with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling</p><p>it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p><p>  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the</p><p>library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal</p><p>permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p><p>  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that</p><p>there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is</p><p>modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know</p><p>that what they have is not the original version, so that the original</p><p>author&#039;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be</p><p>introduced by others.</p><p></p><p>  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of</p><p>any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot</p><p>effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a</p><p>restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that</p><p>any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be</p><p>consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</p><p>  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the</p><p>ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser</p><p>General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and</p><p>is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use</p><p>this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those</p><p>libraries into non-free programs.</p><p>  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using</p><p>a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a</p><p>combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary</p><p>General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the</p><p>entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General</p><p>Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with</p><p>the library.</p><p>  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it</p><p>does Less to protect the user&#039;s freedom than the ordinary General</p><p>Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less</p><p>of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages</p><p>are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many</p><p>libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain</p><p>special circumstances.</p><p>  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to</p><p>encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes</p><p>a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be</p><p>allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free</p><p>library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this</p><p>case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free</p><p>software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</p><p>  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free</p><p>programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of</p><p>free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in</p><p>non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU</p><p>operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating</p><p>system.</p><p>  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the</p><p>users&#039; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is</p><p>linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run</p><p>that program using a modified version of the Library.</p><p>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</p><p>modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</p><p>&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The</p><p>former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must</p><p>be combined with the library in order to run.</p><p></p><p>          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</p><p>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p><p>  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other</p><p>program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or</p><p>other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of</p><p>this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).</p><p>Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p><p>  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data</p><p>prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs</p><p>(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p><p>  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work</p><p>which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the</p><p>Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under</p><p>copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a</p><p>portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated</p><p>straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is</p><p>included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</p><p>  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for</p><p>making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means</p><p>all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated</p><p>interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation</p><p>and installation of the library.</p><p>  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</p><p>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</p><p>running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from</p><p>such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based</p><p>on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for</p><p>writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does</p><p>and what the program that uses the Library does.</p><p>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#039;s</p><p>complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that</p><p>you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an</p><p>appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact</p><p>all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any</p><p>warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the</p><p>Library.</p><p>  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</p><p>and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a</p><p>fee.</p><p></p><p>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</p><p>of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and</p><p>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</p><p>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p><p>    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</p><p>    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</p><p>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p><p>    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</p><p>    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p><p>    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a</p><p>    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses</p><p>    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility</p><p>    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</p><p>    in the event an application does not supply such function or</p><p>    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</p><p>    its purpose remains meaningful.</p><p>    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has</p><p>    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</p><p>    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</p><p>    application-supplied function or table used by this function must</p><p>    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</p><p>    root function must still compute square roots.)</p><p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</p><p>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</p><p>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</p><p>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</p><p>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</p><p>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</p><p>on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</p><p>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</p><p>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</p><p>it.</p><p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</p><p>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</p><p>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</p><p>collective works based on the Library.</p><p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library</p><p>with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of</p><p>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</p><p>the scope of this License.</p><p>  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</p><p>License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do</p><p>this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so</p><p>that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</p><p>instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the</p><p>ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify</p><p>that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in</p><p>these notices.</p><p></p><p>  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</p><p>that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all</p><p>subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p><p>  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</p><p>the Library into a program that is not a library.</p><p>  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or</p><p>derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form</p><p>under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany</p><p>it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which</p><p>must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</p><p>medium customarily used for software interchange.</p><p>  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy</p><p>from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</p><p>source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to</p><p>distribute the source code, even though third parties are not</p><p>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p><p>  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</p><p>Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</p><p>linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a</p><p>work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</p><p>therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p><p>  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library</p><p>creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</p><p>contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the</p><p>library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</p><p>Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p><p>  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file</p><p>that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a</p><p>derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</p><p>Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</p><p>linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The</p><p>threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p><p>  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</p><p>structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline</p><p>functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object</p><p>file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative</p><p>work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the</p><p>Library will still fall under Section 6.)</p><p>  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</p><p>distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</p><p>Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,</p><p>whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</p><p></p><p>  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or</p><p>link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a</p><p>work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work</p><p>under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit</p><p>modification of the work for the customer&#039;s own use and reverse</p><p>engineering for debugging such modifications.</p><p>  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</p><p>Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</p><p>this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</p><p>during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</p><p>copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</p><p>directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</p><p>of these things:</p><p>    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</p><p>    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</p><p>    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</p><p>    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</p><p>    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that</p><p>    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the</p><p>    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</p><p>    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</p><p>    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</p><p>    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</p><p>    to use the modified definitions.)</p><p>    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the</p><p>    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a</p><p>    copy of the library already present on the user&#039;s computer system,</p><p>    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)</p><p>    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if</p><p>    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is</p><p>    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</p><p>    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at</p><p>    least three years, to give the same user the materials</p><p>    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more</p><p>    than the cost of performing this distribution.</p><p>    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</p><p>    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</p><p>    specified materials from the same place.</p><p>    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</p><p>    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</p><p>  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the</p><p>Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for</p><p>reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</p><p>the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is</p><p>normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</p><p>components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</p><p>which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</p><p>the executable.</p><p>  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</p><p>restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</p><p>accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot</p><p>use both them and the Library together in an executable that you</p><p>distribute.</p><p></p><p>  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</p><p>Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library</p><p>facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined</p><p>library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on</p><p>the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise</p><p>permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p><p>    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</p><p>    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library</p><p>    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the</p><p>    Sections above.</p><p>    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</p><p>    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining</p><p>    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p><p>  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</p><p>the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any</p><p>attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or</p><p>distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your</p><p>rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,</p><p>or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</p><p>terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p><p>  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</p><p>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</p><p>distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are</p><p>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</p><p>modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the</p><p>Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</p><p>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</p><p>the Library or works based on it.</p><p>  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the</p><p>Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</p><p>original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library</p><p>subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</p><p>restrictions on the recipients&#039; exercise of the rights granted herein.</p><p>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with</p><p>this License.</p><p></p><p>  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</p><p>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</p><p>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</p><p>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</p><p>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</p><p>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</p><p>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</p><p>may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent</p><p>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by</p><p>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</p><p>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</p><p>refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</p><p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any</p><p>particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,</p><p>and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p><p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</p><p>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</p><p>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</p><p>integrity of the free software distribution system which is</p><p>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</p><p>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</p><p>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</p><p>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</p><p>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</p><p>impose that choice.</p><p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</p><p>be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p><p>  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in</p><p>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</p><p>original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add</p><p>an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,</p><p>so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus</p><p>excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if</p><p>written in the body of this License.</p><p>  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new</p><p>versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.</p><p>Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,</p><p>but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p><p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library</p><p>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and</p><p>&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and</p><p>conditions either of that version or of any later version published by</p><p>the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a</p><p>license version number, you may choose any version ever published by</p><p>the Free Software Foundation.</p><p></p><p>  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free</p><p>programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,</p><p>write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is</p><p>copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free</p><p>Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our</p><p>decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status</p><p>of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing</p><p>and reuse of software generally.</p><p>                NO WARRANTY</p><p>  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO</p><p>WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p><p>EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR</p><p>OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY</p><p>KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE</p><p>IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR</p><p>PURPOSE.

If Contributor obtains such</p><p>        knowledge after the Modification is made available as</p><p>        described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify</p><p>        the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available</p><p>        thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying</p><p>        appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated</p><p>        to inform those who received the Covered Code that new</p><p>        knowledge has been obtained.</p><p>        (b) Contributor APIs.</p><p>        If Contributor&#039;s Modifications include an application</p><p>        programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent</p><p>        licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API,</p><p>        Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL</p><p>        file.</p><p>        (c)    Representations.</p><p>        Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to</p><p>        Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#039;s</p><p>        Modifications are Contributor&#039;s original creation(s) and/or</p><p>        Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed</p><p>        by this License.</p><p>    3.5. Required Notices.</p><p>    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the</p><p>    Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a</p><p>    particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must</p><p>    include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)</p><p>    where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You</p><p>    created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a</p><p>    Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also</p><p>    duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code</p><p>    where You describe recipients&#039; rights or ownership rights relating</p><p>    to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee</p><p>    for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one</p><p>    or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on</p><p>    Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any</p><p>    Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such</p><p>    warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by</p><p>    You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer</p><p>    and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial</p><p>    Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,</p><p>    indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p><p>    3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</p><p>    You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the</p><p>    requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered</p><p>    Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code</p><p>    version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this</p><p>    License, including a description of how and where You have</p><p>    fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be</p><p>    conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,</p><p>    related documentation or collateral in which You describe</p><p>    recipients&#039; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may</p><p>    distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership</p><p>    rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms</p><p>    different from this License, provided that You are in compliance</p><p>    with the terms of this License and that the license for the</p><p>    Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the</p><p>    recipient&#039;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set</p><p>    forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version</p><p>    under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that</p><p>    any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone,</p><p>    not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree</p><p>    to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any</p><p>    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as</p><p>    a result of any such terms You offer.</p><p>    3.7. Larger Works.</p><p>    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other</p><p>    code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the</p><p>    Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make</p><p>    sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the</p><p>    Covered Code.</p><p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</p><p>    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of</p><p>    this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due</p><p>    to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a)</p><p>    comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent</p><p>    possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they</p><p>    affect.

Application of this License.</p><p>    This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has</p><p>    attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.</p><p>6. Versions of the License.</p><p>    6.1. New Versions.</p><p>    Netscape Communications Corporation (&#039;&#039;Netscape&#039;&#039;) may publish</p><p>    revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each</p><p>    version will be given a distinguishing version number.</p><p>    6.2. Effect of New Versions.</p><p>    Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of</p><p>    the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of</p><p>    that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under</p><p>    the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by</p><p>    Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the</p><p>    terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.</p><p>    6.3. Derivative Works.</p><p>    If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you</p><p>    may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already</p><p>    Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your</p><p>    license so that the phrases &#039;&#039;Mozilla&#039;&#039;, &#039;&#039;MOZILLAPL&#039;&#039;, &#039;&#039;MOZPL&#039;&#039;,</p><p>    &#039;&#039;Netscape&#039;&#039;, &quot;MPL&quot;, &#039;&#039;NPL&#039;&#039; or any confusingly similar phrase do</p><p>    not appear in your license (except to note that your license</p><p>    differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that</p><p>    Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the</p><p>    Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in</p><p>    the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in</p><p>    the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be</p><p>    deemed to be modifications of this License.)</p><p>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p><p>    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&#039;&#039; BASIS,</p><p>    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,</p><p>    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS</p><p>    FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR</p><p>    NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE</p><p>    OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE</p><p>    DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY</p><p>    OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,</p><p>    REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN</p><p>    ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS</p><p>    AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p><p>8. TERMINATION.</p><p>    8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate</p><p>    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to</p><p>    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the</p><p>    breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly</p><p>    granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions</p><p>    which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the</p><p>    termination of this License shall survive.</p><p>    8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent</p><p>    infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against</p><p>    Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or</p><p>    Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as</p><p>    &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:</p><p>    (a) such Participant&#039;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly</p><p>    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such</p><p>    Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License</p><p>    shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate</p><p>    prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice</p><p>    You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually</p><p>    agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of</p><p>    Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your</p><p>    litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against</p><p>    such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable</p><p>    royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in</p><p>    writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn,</p><p>    the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or</p><p>    2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice</p><p>    period specified above.</p><p>    (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such</p><p>    Participant&#039;s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly</p><p>    infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such</p><p>    Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective</p><p>    as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had</p><p>    made, Modifications made by that Participant.</p><p>    8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against</p><p>    Participant alleging that such Participant&#039;s Contributor Version</p><p>    directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is</p><p>    resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the</p><p>    initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable</p><p>    value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections</p><p>    2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount</p><p>    or value of any payment or license.</p><p>    8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,</p><p>    all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and</p><p>    resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any</p><p>    distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive</p><p>    termination.</p><p>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p><p>    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT</p><p>    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE</p><p>    INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF</p><p>    COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO</p><p>    ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL</p><p>    DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES</p><p>    FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR</p><p>    MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,</p><p>    EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF</p><p>    SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO</p><p>    LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#039;S</p><p>    NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH</p><p>    LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR</p><p>    LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS</p><p>    EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p><p>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</p><p>    The Covered Code is a &#039;&#039;commercial item,&#039;&#039; as that term is defined</p><p>    in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &#039;&#039;commercial</p><p>    computer software&#039;&#039; and &#039;&#039;commercial computer software</p><p>    documentation,&#039;&#039; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212</p><p>    (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48</p><p>    C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all</p><p>    U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those</p><p>    rights set forth herein.</p><p>11. MISCELLANEOUS.</p><p>    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject</p><p>    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be</p><p>    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent</p><p>    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed</p><p>    by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law,</p><p>    if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law</p><p>    provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party</p><p>    is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do</p><p>    business in the United States of America, any litigation relating</p><p>    to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the</p><p>    Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue</p><p>    lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party</p><p>    responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs</p><p>    and reasonable attorneys&#039; fees and expenses. The application of</p><p>    the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International</p><p>    Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which</p><p>    provides that the language of a contract shall be construed</p><p>    against the drafter shall not apply to this License.</p><p>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p><p>    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is</p><p>    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or</p><p>    indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License</p><p>    and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to</p><p>    distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing</p><p>    herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission</p><p>    of liability.</p><p>13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.</p><p>    Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as</p><p>    �Multiple-Licensed�.  �Multiple-Licensed� means that the Initial</p><p>    Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code</p><p>    under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any,</p><p>    specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in</p><p>    Exhibit A.</p><p>EXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License.</p><p>    ``The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public</p><p>    License Version 1.1 (the &quot;License&quot;); you may not use this file</p><p>    except in compliance with the License.

By contrast, the GNU General Public</p><p>  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free</p><p>  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This</p><p>  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</p><p>  Foundation&#039;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to</p><p>  using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</p><p>  the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</p><p>  your programs, too.</p><p>    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</p><p>  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</p><p>  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</p><p>  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</p><p>  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</p><p>  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p><p>    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</p><p>  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</p><p>  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</p><p>  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p><p>    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</p><p>  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</p><p>  you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</p><p>  source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</p><p>  rights.</p><p>    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</p><p>  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</p><p>  distribute and/or modify the software.</p><p>    Also, for each author&#039;s protection and ours, we want to make certain</p><p>  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</p><p>  software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</p><p>  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</p><p>  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</p><p>  authors&#039; reputations.</p><p>    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</p><p>  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</p><p>  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</p><p>  program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</p><p>  patent must be licensed for everyone&#039;s free use or not licensed at all.</p><p>    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</p><p>  modification follow.</p><p>	  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</p><p>     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p><p>    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains</p><p>  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed</p><p>  under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,</p><p>  refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;</p><p>  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:</p><p>  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,</p><p>  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another</p><p>  language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in</p><p>  the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p><p>  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</p><p>  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</p><p>  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program</p><p>  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</p><p>  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).</p><p>  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p><p>    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#039;s</p><p>  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</p><p>  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</p><p>  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</p><p>  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</p><p>  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</p><p>  along with the Program.</p><p>  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</p><p>  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p><p>    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</p><p>  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</p><p>  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</p><p>  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p><p>      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</p><p>      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p><p>      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</p><p>      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</p><p>      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</p><p>      parties under the terms of this License.</p><p>      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</p><p>      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</p><p>      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</p><p>      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</p><p>      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</p><p>      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</p><p>      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</p><p>      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</p><p>      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</p><p>      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</p><p>  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</p><p>  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</p><p>  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</p><p>  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</p><p>  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</p><p>  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</p><p>  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</p><p>  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</p><p>  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p><p>  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</p><p>  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</p><p>  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</p><p>  collective works based on the Program.</p><p>  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</p><p>  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</p><p>  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</p><p>  the scope of this License.</p><p>    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</p><p>  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</p><p>  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p><p>      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</p><p>      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</p><p>      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p><p>      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</p><p>      years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</p><p>      cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</p><p>      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</p><p>      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</p><p>      customarily used for software interchange; or,</p><p>      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</p><p>      to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is</p><p>      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</p><p>      received the program in object code or executable form with such</p><p>      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p><p>  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</p><p>  making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source</p><p>  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</p><p>  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</p><p>  control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a</p><p>  special exception, the source code distributed need not include</p><p>  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</p><p>  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</p><p>  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</p><p>  itself accompanies the executable.</p><p>  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</p><p>  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</p><p>  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</p><p>  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</p><p>  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p><p>    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</p><p>  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt</p><p>  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</p><p>  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</p><p>  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</p><p>  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</p><p>  parties remain in full compliance.</p><p>    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</p><p>  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</p><p>  distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</p><p>  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</p><p>  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</p><p>  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</p><p>  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</p><p>  the Program or works based on it.</p><p>    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</p><p>  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</p><p>  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</p><p>  these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</p><p>  restrictions on the recipients&#039; exercise of the rights granted herein.</p><p>  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</p><p>  this License.</p><p>    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</p><p>  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</p><p>  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</p><p>  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</p><p>  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</p><p>  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</p><p>  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</p><p>  may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent</p><p>  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</p><p>  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</p><p>  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</p><p>  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p><p>  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</p><p>  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</p><p>  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</p><p>  circumstances.</p><p>  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</p><p>  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</p><p>  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</p><p>  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is</p><p>  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</p><p>  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</p><p>  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</p><p>  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</p><p>  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</p><p>  impose that choice.</p><p>  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</p><p>  be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p><p>    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in</p><p>  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</p><p>  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License</p><p>  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding</p><p>  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</p><p>  countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates</p><p>  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p><p>    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</p><p>  of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</p><p>  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</p><p>  address new problems or concerns.</p><p>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program</p><p>  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any</p><p>  later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions</p><p>  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free</p><p>  Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of</p><p>  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software</p><p>  Foundation.</p><p>    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free</p><p>  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author</p><p>  to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free</p><p>  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes</p><p>  make exceptions for this.

It is safest</p><p>  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</p><p>  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</p><p>  the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p><p>      &lt;one line to give the program&#039;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</p><p>      Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</p><p>      This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify</p><p>      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by</p><p>      the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or</p><p>      (at your option) any later version.</p><p>      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,</p><p>      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of</p><p>      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM</p><p>CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&#039;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p><p>1. DEFINITIONS</p><p>&quot;Contribution&quot; means:</p><p>    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and</p><p>       documentation distributed under this Agreement, and</p><p>    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:</p><p>        i) changes to the Program, and</p><p>        ii) additions to the Program;</p><p>where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are</p><p>distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &#039;originates&#039;</p><p>from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself</p><p>or anyone acting on such Contributor&#039;s behalf. Contributions do not include</p><p>additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software</p><p>distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,</p><p>and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.</p><p>&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.</p><p>&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are</p><p>necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or</p><p>when combined with the Program.</p><p>&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with</p><p>this Agreement.</p><p>&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,</p><p>including all Contributors.</p><p>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</p><p>    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants</p><p>       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to</p><p>       reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly</p><p>       perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such</p><p>       Contributor, if any, and such derivative works,</p><p>       in source code and object code form.</p><p>    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants</p><p>       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under</p><p>       Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and</p><p>       otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any,</p><p>       in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply</p><p>       to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time</p><p>       the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the</p><p>       Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the</p><p>       Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other</p><p>       combinations which include the Contribution.</p><p>       No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.</p><p>    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the</p><p>       licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are</p><p>       provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the</p><p>       patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.</p><p>       Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims</p><p>       brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual</p><p>       property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the</p><p>       rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes</p><p>       sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights</p><p>       needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is</p><p>       required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is</p><p>       Recipient&#039;s responsibility to acquire that license</p><p>       before distributing the Program.</p><p>    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient</p><p>       copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright</p><p>       license set forth in this Agreement.</p><p>3. REQUIREMENTS</p><p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under</p><p>its own license agreement, provided that:</p><p>    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and</p><p>    b) its license agreement:</p><p>        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties</p><p>        and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or</p><p>        conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or</p><p>        conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</p><p>        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability</p><p>        for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and</p><p>        consequential damages, such as lost profits;</p><p>        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are</p><p>        offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and</p><p>        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such</p><p>        Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable</p><p>        manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.</p><p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p><p>    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p><p>    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.</p><p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained</p><p>within the Program.</p><p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,</p><p>if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to</p><p>identify the originator of the Contribution.</p><p>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</p><p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with</p><p>respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is</p><p>intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who</p><p>includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner</p><p>which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,</p><p>if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,</p><p>such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and</p><p>indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any</p><p>losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims,</p><p>lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the</p><p>Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of</p><p>such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program</p><p>in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply</p><p>to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual</p><p>property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:</p><p>a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,</p><p>and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the</p><p>Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement</p><p>negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such</p><p>claim at its own expense.</p><p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product</p><p>offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.</p><p>If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers</p><p>warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties</p><p>are such Commercial Contributor&#039;s responsibility alone. Under this section,</p><p>the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other</p><p>Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a</p><p>court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result,</p><p>the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.</p><p>5. NO WARRANTY</p><p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN</p><p>&quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR</p><p>IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,</p><p>NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p><p>Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of</p><p>using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its</p><p>exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the</p><p>risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to</p><p>or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability</p><p>or interruption of operations.</p><p>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</p><p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY</p><p>CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,</p><p>SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION</p><p>LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN</p><p>CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)</p><p>ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE</p><p>EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE</p><p>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p><p>7. GENERAL</p><p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under</p><p>applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the</p><p>remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by</p><p>the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent</p><p>necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p><p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a</p><p>cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself</p><p>(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)</p><p>infringes such Recipient&#039;s patent(s), then such Recipient&#039;s rights granted</p><p>under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p><p>All Recipient&#039;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to</p><p>comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and</p><p>does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming</p><p>aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&#039;s rights under this</p><p>Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the</p><p>Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&#039;s obligations</p><p>under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the</p><p>Program shall continue and survive.</p><p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,</p><p>but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may</p><p>only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves</p><p>the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement</p><p>from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to</p><p>modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial</p><p>Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to</p><p>serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version</p><p>of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program</p><p>(including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version</p><p>of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version</p><p>of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program</p><p>(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly</p><p>stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or</p><p>licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,</p><p>whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
